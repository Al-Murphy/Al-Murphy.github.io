excerpt: 'we have developed MungeSumstats, a Bioconductor R package for the standardization and quality control of GWAS summary statistics. MungeSumstats can handle the most common summary statistic formats, including variant call format (VCF) producing a reformatted, standardized, tabular summary statistic file, VCF or R native data object.'

<b>Motivation:</b> Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics have popularized and accelerated genetic
research. However, a lack of standardization of the file formats used has proven problematic when running secondary analysis tools or performing meta-analysis studies.

<b>Results:</b> To address this issue, we have developed MungeSumstats, a Bioconductor R package for the standardization and quality control of GWAS summary statistics. MungeSumstats can handle the most common summary statistic formats, including variant call format (VCF) producing a reformatted, standardized, tabular summary statistic
file, VCF or R native data object.

<b>Availability and implementation:</b> MungeSumstats is available on Bioconductor (v 3.13) and can also be found on
Github at: https://neurogenomics.github.io/MungeSumstats.
